"The Toga Web backend is the least mature of all the Toga backends. It's "
"mature enough to show off a few features, but it's likely to be buggy, and "
"will be missing many of the widgets that are available on other platforms. "
"At this point in time, Web deployment should be considered a "
"\"Proof of Concept\" - enough to demonstrate what can be done, but not "
"enough to be relied on for serious development."

"The process of deploying as a single-page web app follows the same familiar "

"it. However, Briefcase can be a little bit smart; if you attempt to run an "
"application, and Briefcase determines that it hasn't been created or built "
"for the platform being targeted, it will do the create and build steps for "
"you. Since this is our first time running the app for the web, we can "

"browser, building the UI using the browser DOM. When you click a button, "
