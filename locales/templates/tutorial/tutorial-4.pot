"Why is this? Well, `briefcase dev` operates by running your code in place -"
"it tries to produce as realistic runtime environment for your code as "

"So - we need to tell briefcase to update your app, copying in the new "

"If you're rapidly iterating code changes, you'll likely want to make a code "

"most purposes, developer mode (`briefcase dev`) will be the easiest way to "
"do this sort of rapid iteration; however, if you're testing something about "
"how your application runs as a native binary, or hunting a bug that only "
"manifests when your application is in packaged form, you may need to use "
"repeated calls to `briefcase run`. To simplify the process of updating and "
